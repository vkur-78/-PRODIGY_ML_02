# PRODIGY_ML_02 - KMeans Clustering for Mall Customers

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of KMeans clustering on the "mall_customers.csv" dataset to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. The primary objective is to leverage unsupervised learning techniques for customer segmentation.

## Dataset

The dataset, "mall_customers.csv," comprises the following columns:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: Score based on customer behavior and purchasing data

## Approach

The project involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Exploring the dataset and encoding categorical variables.
2. **KMeans Clustering:** Applying the KMeans algorithm to group customers based on their annual income and spending score.
3. **Visualization:** Creating visualizations to understand and interpret the formed clusters.

## Files

- **mall_customers.csv:** Dataset for clustering.
- **KMeans_Clustering.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for KMeans clustering.
- **README.md:** Overview of the project (this file).

## Usage

To run the code:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
3. Open and run the `KMeans_Clustering.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.

## Results

The output includes visualizations illustrating the clusters formed based on annual income and spending score. These clusters help identify distinct customer segments, aiding in the development of targeted marketing strategies.
